# 3D_House_Computer_Graphics
 A Computer Graphics project based on the concept of a “3D House”. This project implements the view of a 3D House both inside and outside of the house. There are 4 components that are placed in the house they are a exhaust fan, two window, a door and stairs. The exhaust fan rotate clockwise and anticlockwise. I develop the model using C++.
